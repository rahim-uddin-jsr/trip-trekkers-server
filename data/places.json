        "description": "Cox's Bazar sea beach is the longest sea beach in the world, 120 km long, having no 2nd instance.The wavy water of Bay of Bengal touches the beach throughout this 120 km. For Bangladeshi's it doesn't get much better than Cox's Bazar, the country's most popular beach town than the other one 'Kuakata beach town. It's sort of a Cancun of the east.It's choc-a-bloc with massive well-architectured concrete structures, affluent 5 & 3 star hotels, catering largely to the country's elite and overseas tourists.The beach is only a bit crowded in tourist season, October to March, especially near the hotel - motel zone, but remains virgin during the rest of the year, April to September, when it's better to take a trip there.",

        "description": "The Sundarbans mangrove forest is one of the most extensive single such forests in the world (140,000 ha). It lies on the delta of the Bay’s Ganges, Brahmaputra, and Meghna rivers of Bengal. It is adjacent to the border of India’s Sundarbans World Heritage site inscribed in 1987. The site is intersected by a complex network of tidal waterways, mudflats, and small islands of salt-tolerant mangroves.  It presents an excellent example of ongoing ecological processes. The area is known for its wide range of fauna, including 260 bird species, the man-eating Bengal tiger, and other threatened species such as the estuarine crocodile and the Indian python. This tour starts from Dhaka with the modern Rocket Ship. It covers Sixty domed mosques, Khan Jahan Ali shrine at Bagerhat and Harbaria, Kotka & Kochikhali wildlife sanctuary, and many more activities in Sundarbans.",
